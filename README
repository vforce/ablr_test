Setup virtual env
```shell script
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server with 
```
cd interview
python manage.py runsever localhost:3001
```

Go to `localhost:3001`. 
Follow the consent link on the page 
After clicking on the `I Agree` button, you will be redirected back to `localhost:3001` with content of decrypted data displayed on the page. 

The decrypted content will be written to data.json file. Next time you visit to the page `localhost:3001` you will not go through the same process like above. If you're inclined to do so, please kindly remove the `data.json` file.

I added a couple of tests in `interview/tests`. To run them, please use 
```
python manage.py test
```
